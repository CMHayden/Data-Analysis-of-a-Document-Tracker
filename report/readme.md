## 1. Introduction

## 2. Requirements Checklist

| Requirement                                                                       | Achieved?     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Core logic of application must be in Python 3                                     | Yes           |
| Views by country and continent                                                    | Yes           |
| Views by browser                                                                  | Yes           |
| "Also likes" document suggestion functionality                                    | Yes           |
| "Also likes" graph                                                                | No            |
| GUI functionality with tkinter                                                    | Yes           |
| Command line functionality                                                        | Yes           |

All of the requirements have been completed apart from creating an "also likes" graph. 

I think, this may be changed in future I guess?

## 3. Design Considerations

### Using Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a data type in Python. They act like lists but differ primarily by being accesible via their keys instead of via indexing. This allowed us to count occurences without the need of looping through a list and using if statements for every scenario. Here is an example where we used dictionaries to check every country in the list data, and check which continent it belongs to before adding the value associated with each country to the continent to allow for counting the views of a document by continent.

```python
for country in data:
    try:
        continentsDict[countriesDict[country]] = continentsDict[countriesDict[country]] + data[country]
    except KeyError:
        print("Countries continent not found: " + country)
```

One alternative would be to use if statements. This would mean having to use an if statement for every possible country. This would be very inefficient due to having to do such a large quantity of comparisons. This would cause the application to be extremely slow when using a large quantity of data. Here is an example of this:

```python
for country in data:
    if country == "AL":
        Europe = Europe + 1
    elif country == "AS":
        Europe = Europe + 1
    elif
    # and so forth for every country and every continent
```

A third alternative is to store the data in a dictionary much like the first and chosen option, but checking if what the data corresponds to by using lists. When found then you would count it by adding the value of the dictionary to a variable for the corresponding data. This can be seen with a dictionary (data), variables (Europe, Africa...), and lists (europe, africa...) in the example below. 

```python
for country in data:
    if country is in europe:
        Europe = Europe + dictionary[country]
    elif country is in africa:
        Africa = Africa + dictionary[country]
    # And so forth for every continent.
```

## 4. User Guide

This application has two very distinct user interfaces. One is the command line interface and the other is the graphical user interface. They both allow for the same functionality, only they are used in different ways.

### Command Line Interface

The command line interface, while more complicated for everyday users, allows for quick interaction for more advanced users. It allows for typing commands to do tasks and passing parameters into the tasks. There is a limitation towards what commands can be understood by this interface. A valid command has the following structure:

```bash
% python3 cw2.py -u user_uuid -d doc_uuid -t task_id -f file_name
```

A valid command starts with python3 to tell the machine to run the application with python3, followed by the applications python file name which is cw2.py. After this what comes can be totally optional using the following commands:

* **-t**: sets the task the application will perform and allows for the following parameters:
    * *2a* - Display a histogram of countries of the viewers.
    * *2b* - Display a histogram of continents of the viewers.
    * *3a* - Display a histogram of all browser identifiers of viewers.
    * *3b* - Display a histogram of browser names of viewers.
    * *4d* - Display a list of other documents the reader may like.
    * *5* - Display a graph of relationship between a document and all documents found as also like documents.
    * *6* - Display a graph based on task *5*.
    * *7* - Display a line chart showing the frequency of views of a given document over time.

* **-f**: sets the file to be used by the application. The expected parameter is the location of the file.

* **-u**: sets a user ID that will be passed into the requested task.

* **-d**: sets a document ID that will be passed into the requested task.

* **-h** *or* **--help**: calls the help function which will display a small user guide on the command line to ensure the user is able to get help when needed. This screen can be seen here:
